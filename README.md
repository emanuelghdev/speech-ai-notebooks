# Word Chain Game: Speech Recognition & Synthesis

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on the study and practical implementation of end-to-end speech systems. It covers core speech technologies such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS), and includes an interactive word-chain game that integrates both components into a complete speech processing pipeline.

These notebooks were developed as part of academic practice and are intended to illustrate the design, experimentation and integration of speech AI components in applied scenarios.
